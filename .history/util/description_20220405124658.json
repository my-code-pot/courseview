Socially Engaged Art in the Americas\nCan art change the world? Questions about the impact of art in the social fabric are constitutive of the idea of avant-garde art. This course will introduce students to these debates as they took shape in the American continent since 1960. With an emphasis on forms of art practice that outspokenly seek to provoke positive social change, this class provides a parallel narrative of contemporary art, in which art exits the museum space to ingrain itself in broader social processes.\nDuring the semester students will learn about different theories of socially engaged art articulated by artists and art historians alike. We will consider art as activism in the Civil Rights era, forms of artistic resistance to Latin American military dictatorships, second wave feminist art, contemporary community-based art, and forms of engaged art practice concerned with planet-wide environmental crisis. We will debate the tactics and ideals guiding these practices, and we will evaluate the potential risks that come with relying on art for social transformation. This course alternates short lecture periods with in-class discussion of primary and secondary sources. It is structured around six thematic blocs, at the end of which students will produce a short written assignment. \nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nEligible for ESCH, PEAC, GLBL-paired, LALS\nFall 2021.

Building New Worlds: The Arts and Architectures of Liberation\nThis mid-level course examines the legacies of artists and architects who, since the 1960s, have relied on the power of cultural work in struggles for racial emancipation. It centers the contributions to the fields of socially engaged art and architecture of African American, Latinx, Asian American, and Native American practitioners who worked to make the United States a nation for all. Faced with a hostile environment of systemic racism that often excluded them from institutions of artistic and architectural legitimacy, these practitioners relied on imagination and the power of community to plan, realize, and historize their interventions. We will focus on six sites of the built environment that have historically been settings of struggle against racialized systemic violence: the prison, the home, public space, the school, the international border, and the neighborhood.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nCatalog chapter: Art and Art History \nDepartment website: http://www.swarthmore.edu/art-and-art-history\n\nCheck the Spring 2022 Schedule of Courses\nCheck the Fall 2022 Schedule of Courses": "ARTH 001D.

Starting from the production of materials from which we construct architecture and ending with the decline, deterioration, and afterlife of structures, this discussion-based course will offer a chance to reflect on the labor that constructs the built environment and the many people who are involved in its production from the very beginning to the very end. Beyond the architect, we will also consider the role of miners and manufacturers, finance capital, labor unions, construction workers, users and renovators, maintenance staff, and those involved in deconstruction and resale.

Global Contemporary Art: Honors Seminar\nWhat is \u2018Global Contemporary Art\u2019? Since the end of the Cold War, contemporary art has experienced a phenomenon of rapid planet wide expansion. Over 600 art fairs and biennial exhibitions structure a network where artworks, art professionals, and ideas circulate periodically, informing a community autonomous -yet connected to- local art scenes. In these last three decades, avant-garde art as practiced in Europe and the United States has expanded to acquire planetary visibility. Simultaneously, traditions of art making from other regions of the world have been welcomed -albeit in altered fashion-, into the central stages of the artworld. As historians, artists, and critics: How do we make sense of this shift? More importantly: How do we fit in this picture?\n  In this seminar, students will learn about the institutional, epistemic, and sociopolitical processes involved in the formation of \u2018global contemporary art\u2019 as a new art historical category. We will study the role that exhibitions, academia, and the art market play in the setting of artistic trends, while we analyze how these influences materialize in the practice of artists around the globe. During the semester students will engage with primary sources such as artworks and artists writings, and secondary sources from the art industry and academia alike. At the end of this course, students will be ready to describe the political, economic, and cultural processes active in the globalization of the art industry since 1990, and reflect on the consequences of this process in academic, practiced, and curatorial approaches to contemporary art.\nPrerequisite: Two courses in art history or permission of instructor.\nHumanities.\nWriting.\n2 credits.\nEligible for GLBL - Core\nSpring 2024.

Arts & Crafts as Avant-Garde Labor\nThe relationship between the arts and the crafts is\u2026 complicated. Since the mid 19th Century, artists, theorists, industrialists, and reformers have tried to define the terms of their bond, albeit unsuccessfully. While some defend their necessary entanglement and permanent cross-pollination, others work hard to defend their fundamental incompatibility. In this honors seminar students study the nuances of this messy yet fertile affair involving avant-garde art and artisan productions from the 1850s until today. They hypothesize on the foundations of their attraction and thread through the different historical narratives that have argued for or against their marriage. This course considers the status of artisanship with regards to art making in the Arts & Crafts movement, 20th century modernism, the Black arts movement, feminist art, decolonial aesthetics, and new materialism studies. So as to better understand this complicated liaison, students will craft two fabric objects and reflect on their experience as artisans, or artists, in the making.\nHumanities.\n2 credits.\nCatalog chapter: Art and Art History \nDepartment website: https://www.swarthmore.edu/art-and-art-history\n\nCheck the Spring 2022 Schedule of Courses\nCheck the Fall 2022 Schedule of Courses": "ARTH 001D.

Modern Architecture and Urbanism: Honors Seminar\n[Print Course (opens a new window)]\nARTH 153. Modern Architecture and Urbanism: Honors Seminar\nThis honors seminar examines the broad array of designed and built works, makers, sites, and texts that constitute modern architecture and urbanism. Students will interpret the many facets of modernism through key historical readings-both primary and secondary, canonical and revisionist; analysis of examples; and consideration of their makers, both well-known and less so. A guiding assumption is that modernism was never only one thing and had different-even sometimes opposite-intentions, manifestations, and consequences in different contexts. Yet we will follow one persistent question as a link across the semester: how did modern architects and urbanists seek to create a better world? The motivations behind and answers to this defining question of modernism were never consistent across our period of study. While centering designed objects, then, we will interrogate how people have experienced modernism differently, depending on their identities, subject positions, geographic locations, and social roles. \nPrerequisite: Two courses in art history or permission of instructor.\nHumanities.\n2 credits.\nSpring 2022.

Art of Modern China: Honors Seminar\nThis honors seminar explores modern and contemporary Chinese art and visual culture, with a greater emphasis on the period between the founding of the Republic and the end of the Cultural Revolution. Taking advantage of recent surge in scholarship on visual and material culture from this period, the course examines key artists, movements, and landmark exhibitions, major debates and issues, and how the narrative of modern art has developed in its domestic and global contexts. By studying works across media in tandem with primary sources including artist writings, group manifestoes, and exhibition statements, we consider how artistic concerns engaged with the unfolding seismic sociopolitical and economic transformations in China, as well as with an expanding art world and art market. \nHumanities.\n2 credits.\nFall 2022.

Sculpture I: Form, Material, Process\nThis course serves as an introduction to the foundational materials, techniques, and concepts associated with sculpture. Sculpture I emphasizes the development of skills in wood, steel, and introductory mold-making/casting techniques through a series of hands-on demos and exercises that culminate in creative studio projects. This class also foregrounds creative process, introducing students to the expression of sculptural ideas through iterative studio practice. Each major course project will involve brainstorming, drafting, mocking-up, working, and re-working sculptural objects. We will approach form-making as a language in and of itself, one which demands 3D thinking and making and the development of hands-on, embodied knowledge. Sculpture I prepares students to move onto a variety of Sculpture II courses, where individual concepts and technical skills can be further honed and applied to specific topics in contemporary sculpture. While emphasis falls on introductory techniques in wood, metal, and casting, we will engage a spectrum of finding and making. Students will often be invited to incorporate everyday materials and found objects in relationship to foundational sculptural concepts.  Studio projects will be complemented by field trips, visiting artists, readings, films, and slide presentations, all aimed at developing diverse, nuanced contexts for contemporary sculpture.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nSpring 2023.

Subjects of study will include; still life, the figure, interiors, and the landscape. The development of perceptual skills and the capability to translate visual relationships onto a two dimensional surface is central to this course. No prior painting or drawing experience is necessary. Throughout the semester we will engage in frequent discussions addressing historical and contemporary painting problems. The purpose of these discussions is to provide art historical context and concrete examples of the painting issues we confront in class. In addition to learning about the formal principles of painting, the class will provide an overview of practical tool usage and techniques. An emphasis will be placed on good studio habits, making the environment safe, clean, and productive for everyone.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nFall 2021. Grider. Staff. Staff.\nSpring 2022. Exon.Walsh.

Each excursion will emphasize an aspect of 3D Design, and will present an exercise to study and deepen understanding of 3D form and space (i.e., line, plane, volume, mass, weight, texture, surface, parts-to-whole relationships). By mid-way through the semester, the scope of course projects will expand to involve design challenges on Swarthmore\u2019s campus that involve site analysis, measuring, drawing, and modeling. We will use both analog and digital modes of drawing and modelling. Students will be introduced to human-centered and equity-centered community design practices through our approach to design challenges.

Sculpture II: Meaning and Materiality\nFrom pandemic toilet paper hysteria to Tesla\u2019s cars of the future, we shape material culture and it, in turn, shapes us. As such, this course explores materiality as being central to the human experience, and a primary concern in contemporary sculpture. We will ask: how might materiality drive form and content in works of art? We will consider family histories, vernacular traditions, mass manufacturing, and consumer culture as ways in which materiality intersects with and shapes lived experience. We will ask what things are made of, and what impact they have on the environment. Critical to our exploration will be a consideration of what to make sculpture out of now, in an era defined by ecological precarity and climate change. Studio projects will emphasize material experimentation, process, and iteration.  Advanced mold-making and casting techniques will be covered.  The class will likely work with Recycled Artist in Residence (RAIR) in Philadelphia or an alternative community-based art organization for the culminating course project.\nPrerequisite: ARTT 225 or ARTT 120\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nSpring 2024.
