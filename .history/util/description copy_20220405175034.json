      "ARTH 001C. First-Year Seminar: Making Art History": "ARTH 001C. First-Year Seminar: Making Art History\nAre works of art direct extensions, pure reflections, or unique expressions of an individual artist\u2019s genius, fragile by implication and susceptible to destruction from over analysis? Or are works of art (as well as the definition just offered) cultural artifacts produced under specific material and social conditions, and fully meaningful only under extended analysis? Must we choose? And are these questions themselves, and the talk they generate or suppress, yet another manifestation of the Western European and American commodification of art, its production, and its consumption? Such questions will underlie this introduction to the goals, methods, and history of art history. Focusing on works drawn from a variety of cultures and epochs, as well as on the art historical and critical attention those works have attracted, students will learn to describe, analyze, and interpret both images and their interpretations and to convey their own assessments in lucid writing and speaking.\nHumanities.\nWriting course.\n1 credit.\nCatalog chapter: Art and Art History \nDepartment website: http://www.swarthmore.edu/art",

This area of psychology also draws upon different areas of the discipline, including cognitive and developmental psychology.\nIn this seminar, we will consider and explore psychology in school settings. To do so, we will rely primarily on academic texts, in addition to essays, film, and personal narratives to support our learning and exploration. In many ways, we will build on our own schooling experiences (what has worked and what hasn\u2019t) to think globally about school learning, teaching, and belonging.\n \nPSYC 004 does not serve as an alternate prerequisite for further work in the department.\nSocial sciences.\n1 credit.\nDepartment website: www.swarthmore.edu/educational-studies",

Introduction to Global Studies\nThis course provides an interdisciplinary approach to globally shared issues, processes, interactions and systems that affect people, communities, regions, nations, and our planet.   Some topics the course examines are:  the effects of a globalized world economy, global inequality and poverty, migration and refugees, identity in a global age, world cities, media in the global age, colonization and decolonization, global ethics, global social movements.  The course takes seriously the interaction between the local and the global.  It offers students an opportunity to more strongly command an understanding of their place in the world and an awareness and appreciation of differences through cross-cultural competence as well as a greater ability to mediate these differences. The interdisciplinary nature of the course demands multiple points of entry to communicate and analyze these issues beyond reading and writing, such as films, podcasts, lectures. Each fall Global Studies faculty selects several topics for an in-depth look at the past, present, and future global landscape.\n  Note: GLBL 015 is required for Minors, but open to all and will be offered every fall.\n1 credit.\nEligible for GLBL, POLS\nFall 2021.

Race in Latin America and the Caribbean\nIs it the \u201cone-drop rule,\u201d phenotype, or something else? Indeed, as a social construct, racial categories are created, codified, and contended based on their unique sociopolitical histories. This course will introduce you to the sociological study of race and ethnicity throughout the Americas-North, Central, and South. We will learn how white supremacy, The Transatlantic Slave Trade, and imperialism have shaped the sociohistoric construction of race over time and space and its implications for racial inequality in respective societies. Central to this course, is understanding comparative perspectives with how anti-Blackness and anti-indigeneity is constructed in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the United States. The course invites us to consider how the legacies of European domination persist, and to think critically about how to move forward.\nSocial sciences.\n1 credit.\nEligible for BLST, LALS\nFall 2021.

Introduction to Mathematical Thinking\nStudents will explore ideas and fundamental results from mathematics while we emphasize the thinking and problem-solving skills these ideas stimulate. Class meetings will involve presentation of new material; group work on problems and puzzles; and lively, maybe even passionate discussions about mathematics. This course is intended for students with little background in mathematics or those who may have struggled with math in the past. It is not open to students who already have received credit on their Swarthmore transcripts for mathematics (including Advanced Placement credit),  who concurrently are taking another mathematics course, or who have placed out of any Swarthmore mathematics course.  (See \u201cPlacement Procedure\u201d earlier.) Students planning to go on to calculus should consult with the instructor.

      "MUSI 001A. 1000 Years of Musical Firsts": "MUSI 001A. 1000 Years of Musical Firsts\nMusic 001A is an overview of Western musical history, examining 13 pieces of music as works of art and as moments of cultural history through a detailed study of their premiere performances. Case studies date from the Middle Ages to the twenty-first century, and special attention is given to techniques in musical listening. Each week we will study in detail the premiere performance of a specific musical work. Our focus will be distributed between discussions of the musical sonorities as a primary text and the socio-historical circumstances that gave rise to these works. In this vein, our course is equally a history course, and as the semester progresses you will increasingly see the difficulty in truly separating the \u201cmusic itself\u201d from its cultural contexts. Indeed, these cultural contexts are as much a part of the texts and the way they were created and heard, as the notes on the page.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nFall 2021. Agugliaro.\nFall 2022.

What is their basis (if there is one)? Can values conflict and if yes, what can we do about that? What is freedom of the will and do we enjoy it? What can we know? Nothing? What is knowledge anyway? How can we understand consciousness? Can some machines think? Can the mind be outside the head? How can we or anything remain the same through change? Is there a self? Why is there something rather than nothing? Is death bad? Can life be meaningful or is it absurd? These are fundamental philosophical questions. We will deal with them by reading and discussing some classical but mostly contemporary philosophical texts.\nHumanities.\nWriting course.\n1 credit.\nFall 2021. Baumann.\nSpring 2023.

How do unquestioned assumptions inform what we perceive, believe, and desire, and how might investigating these assumptions shift or affirm our perspectives and instigate new approaches, or give fresh impetus to current approaches, to the problems we face? In this course we will take a chronological look at the distinct world-views of philosophers like Plato, Descartes, and Nietzsche, and then look at the perspectives of some contemporary theorists, in order to ask ourselves questions about when and how we know something to be true, what it is that we desire and why, and how revealing the assumptions we take for granted might affect our perceptions of both.\nHumanities.\nWriting course.\n1 credit.\nCatalog chapter: Philosophy \nDepartment website: http://www.swarthmore.edu/philosophy",

      "PHIL 001H. Introduction to Philosophy: Personal Identity and the Self\nPHIL 001H. Introduction to Philosophy: Personal Identity and the Self\nThis course examines a wide range of interrelated questions surrounding our sense of self and personal identity through time. In particular, it centers on the following questions: What it the nature of the self? Is the self an illusion? What does it take for me to persist through time? Can I survive my bodily death? What are the practical and moral implications of our conception of personal identity?  In addressing these questions, this course aims to cross borders between philosophical traditions coming from different parts of the world, different time periods, and different disciplinary affiliations. Students will have the opportunity to foster new ways of thinking about perennial philosophical puzzles in dialogue with greater thinkers from diverse cultural and historical backgrounds.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nFall 2022.

Foundations: Culture, Power and Meaning\nThis course offers students a foundation in the theories, methods, and history of the discipline of cultural anthropology. Anthropology is a comparative study of culture, practice, and human diversity. This course will introduce students to some of the discipline\u2019s key conceptual innovations, theoretical approaches, and past and present debates. Anthropologists study various societies to understand how meaning is constituted and circulated, how daily practices are structured by social norms and power systems, and how people resist, subvert, and transform inequalities and common modes of identification. Drawing on deep engagement with specific groups, communities, and processes, anthropology offers unique insights into pressing questions of our time, such as the effects of the global circulation of capital and people and how social structures, cultural-political ideologies, and everyday life interact. Topics to be covered include ritual and religion, kinship and family, gift and exchange, citizenship and nationalism, gender and sexuality, medicine and healing, media and circulation, and food and consumption. Students will gain familiarity with ethnography, anthropology\u2019s flagship genre. We will also explore the discipline\u2019s key field research methods and the ethical issues related to its goals to understand, interpret, and represent the lived experiences of people in diverse contexts.\nRequired for SOAN majors and minors.\nSocial sciences.\n1 credit.\nFall 2021.
