      "description": "Are works of art direct extensions, pure reflections, or unique expressions of an individual artist\u2019s genius, fragile by implication and susceptible to destruction from over analysis? Or are works of art (as well as the definition just offered) cultural artifacts produced under specific material and social conditions, and fully meaningful only under extended analysis? Must we choose? And are these questions themselves, and the talk they generate or suppress, yet another manifestation of the Western European and American commodification of art, its production, and its consumption? Such questions will underlie this introduction to the goals, methods, and history of art history. Focusing on works drawn from a variety of cultures and epochs, as well as on the art historical and critical attention those works have attracted, students will learn to describe, analyze, and interpret both images and their interpretations and to convey their own assessments in lucid writing and speaking.\nHumanities.\nWriting course.\n1 credit.\nCatalog chapter: Art and Art History \nDepartment website: http://www.swarthmore.edu/art"

In this discussion-based seminar, we explore the art of enlivenment in East Asia, beginning with early accounts of inanimate objects coming to life, from bronze sculptures of the Buddha walking off of their pedestals in medieval China, deities captured in paintings animated by shamans in Korea, to abandoned furniture and kitchen utensils banding together to seek vengeance on their owners in Japan. Imbued with movement, lifelike dolls, puppets and automata also take on a life of their own, and static images like those painted on a handscroll move to tell riveting stories. We trace this development of moving images into the twentieth century by examining the early history of animation in China and Japan, the emergence of anime and its media culture, and the use of animation in avant-garde art and cinema. \nHumanities.\nWriting course.\n1 credit.\nEligible for ASIA\nSpring 2022.

      "description": "This course will offer a history of architecture not as a history of styles or historical periods but as an account of building, making, and constant remaking. Starting from the production of materials from which we construct architecture and ending with the decline, deterioration, and afterlife of structures, this discussion-based course will offer a chance to reflect on the labor that constructs the built environment and the many people who are involved in its production from the very beginning to the very end. Beyond the architect, we will also consider the role of miners and manufacturers, finance capital, labor unions, construction workers, users and renovators, maintenance staff, and those involved in deconstruction and resale. Over the course of the semester, we will come to understand architecture as constructed by many hands, largely outside of the control of the principal architect, and involving many forms of design.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nFall 2022.

Departing from an examination of how these tensions materialized in New York and Moscow, students will examine how this polarized climate impacted as well artistic production in Western and Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, setting the foundations of a transnational sphere of artistic circulation that anticipated the globalization of art at the turn of the century. \nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nSpring 2022.

      "description": "What is \u2018Global Contemporary Art\u2019? Since the end of the Cold War, contemporary art has experienced a phenomenon of rapid planet wide expansion. Over 600 art fairs and biennial exhibitions structure a network where artworks, art professionals, and ideas circulate periodically, informing a community autonomous -yet connected to- local art scenes. In these last three decades, avant-garde art as practiced in Europe and the United States has expanded to acquire planetary visibility. Simultaneously, traditions of art making from other regions of the world have been welcomed -albeit in altered fashion-, into the central stages of the artworld. As historians, artists, and critics: How do we make sense of this shift? More importantly: How do we fit in this picture?\n  In this seminar, students will learn about the institutional, epistemic, and sociopolitical processes involved in the formation of \u2018global contemporary art\u2019 as a new art historical category. We will study the role that exhibitions, academia, and the art market play in the setting of artistic trends, while we analyze how these influences materialize in the practice of artists around the globe. During the semester students will engage with primary sources such as artworks and artists writings, and secondary sources from the art industry and academia alike. At the end of this course, students will be ready to describe the political, economic, and cultural processes active in the globalization of the art industry since 1990, and reflect on the consequences of this process in academic, practiced, and curatorial approaches to contemporary art.\nPrerequisite: Two courses in art history or permission of instructor.\nHumanities.\nWriting.\n2 credits.\nEligible for GLBL - Core\nSpring 2024.

      "description": "The relationship between the arts and the crafts is\u2026 complicated. Since the mid 19th Century, artists, theorists, industrialists, and reformers have tried to define the terms of their bond, albeit unsuccessfully. While some defend their necessary entanglement and permanent cross-pollination, others work hard to defend their fundamental incompatibility. In this honors seminar students study the nuances of this messy yet fertile affair involving avant-garde art and artisan productions from the 1850s until today. They hypothesize on the foundations of their attraction and thread through the different historical narratives that have argued for or against their marriage. This course considers the status of artisanship with regards to art making in the Arts & Crafts movement, 20th century modernism, the Black arts movement, feminist art, decolonial aesthetics, and new materialism studies. So as to better understand this complicated liaison, students will craft two fabric objects and reflect on their experience as artisans, or artists, in the making.\nHumanities.\n2 credits.\nCatalog chapter: Art and Art History \nDepartment website: https://www.swarthmore.edu/art-and-art-history"

Students will interpret the many facets of modernism through key historical readings-both primary and secondary, canonical and revisionist; analysis of examples; and consideration of their makers, both well-known and less so. A guiding assumption is that modernism was never only one thing and had different-even sometimes opposite-intentions, manifestations, and consequences in different contexts. Yet we will follow one persistent question as a link across the semester: how did modern architects and urbanists seek to create a better world? The motivations behind and answers to this defining question of modernism were never consistent across our period of study. While centering designed objects, then, we will interrogate how people have experienced modernism differently, depending on their identities, subject positions, geographic locations, and social roles. \nPrerequisite: Two courses in art history or permission of instructor.\nHumanities.\n2 credits.\nSpring 2022.

Sculpture I emphasizes the development of skills in wood, steel, and introductory mold-making/casting techniques through a series of hands-on demos and exercises that culminate in creative studio projects. This class also foregrounds creative process, introducing students to the expression of sculptural ideas through iterative studio practice. Each major course project will involve brainstorming, drafting, mocking-up, working, and re-working sculptural objects. We will approach form-making as a language in and of itself, one which demands 3D thinking and making and the development of hands-on, embodied knowledge. Sculpture I prepares students to move onto a variety of Sculpture II courses, where individual concepts and technical skills can be further honed and applied to specific topics in contemporary sculpture. While emphasis falls on introductory techniques in wood, metal, and casting, we will engage a spectrum of finding and making. Students will often be invited to incorporate everyday materials and found objects in relationship to foundational sculptural concepts.

Subjects of study will include; still life, the figure, interiors, and the landscape. The development of perceptual skills and the capability to translate visual relationships onto a two dimensional surface is central to this course. No prior painting or drawing experience is necessary. Throughout the semester we will engage in frequent discussions addressing historical and contemporary painting problems. The purpose of these discussions is to provide art historical context and concrete examples of the painting issues we confront in class. In addition to learning about the formal principles of painting, the class will provide an overview of practical tool usage and techniques. An emphasis will be placed on good studio habits, making the environment safe, clean, and productive for everyone.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nFall 2021. Grider. Staff. Staff.\nSpring 2022. Exon.Walsh.

Installation Art is a porous term used to describe mixed-media artworks designed for a specific space or for a temporary amount of time. Installation has been a prevalent mode of expression within contemporary art since the 1960s, and today is more often a strategy for articulating a particular set of ideas than an all-encompassing genre. Throughout the course, students will explore how they might respond to aspects of their physical surroundings and the built environment through installation. This course will begin with a series of studies, in which students practice their capacity to think both spatially and temporally\u2013 beyond the making of discrete objects. These initial studies will each trace a specific line of thinking and making within installation practices, such as spatial drawing, light and space, and video projection, and will build towards an expanded installation made by students on campus. The culminating course project will be a mock open call in which the class works in small groups to propose a sculptural installation for a specific local context (i.e., a nearby museum, a public space, etc.).\nPrerequisite: ARTT 005A\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nFall 2022.

Imbued with movement, lifelike dolls, puppets and automata also take on a life of their own, and static images like those painted on a handscroll move to tell riveting stories.

Dance offers an unconventional but powerful frame for studying such competing claims of identity formation. This course will explore the interrelated themes of performance, gender, personhood, and migration in the context of diasporic experiences. By focusing on specific dance forms from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, we will examine the trajectories of the global and the local in constructing identity and difference. Students will engage with theories on nationalism, transnationalism, and globalization, as well as embodiment and experience.  Broadly, the course will investigate the interlocking structures of aesthetics and politics, economics and culture, and history and power, all of which inform and continue to reshape these cultures and their dance forms. \n\nThe primary goal for this course is to develop an understanding of cross-cultural identity and difference through the study of dance in contemporary society. The readings will introduce students to the constructed nature of cultural traditions and the contested nature of cultural identities. The writing goals are to teach students how to read critically and write within the disciplines of Anthropology, Dance/Culture Studies, Black Studies, and Global Studies.

There are multiple Japans that emerged in World War II: the empire that might have conquered the US, as imagined in the alternate history of The Man in the High Castle; the lost land of origin that has brought trauma on its \u201cheirs,\u201d the Japanese interned by the US; the Japan experienced by comfort women in Asia.

What might we learn from alternate (hi)stories about the political functions and ontological power of narrative?

Given the minor role to which it is relegated in the world and in Asia, how does the history of Southeast Asia get narrated in its literature-in particular, in literature written in or translated into English, the postwar lingua franca? This course charts modern Southeast Asian history through literature from or about its different periods-from the colonial era to the world between the wars to independence to the contemporary time. In the process, we will examine the literary strategies invented and adopted by locals to tell their (version of) history as well as the language of transmission-a language that, as it becomes more and more universal, might efface the very thing for which we are looking.

We will learn about the indentured labor trade that brought Indian and Chinese laborers to the Americas in the 19th-20th centuries, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the case of Bhagat Singh Thind, and Japanese internment camps during WWII, in addition to other examples of racism and resistance that Asians faced migrating across the Americas. Our focus will be on how Asians have sacralized the local landscape and maintained and/or altered their religious practices, as well as how Asians have penetrated the culture of the Americas, looking at topics like food, architecture (temples and religious institutions), music, and pop culture. As part of the emphasis on culture, we will also explore the impact of Asian religions on American culture from the early transcendentalists to the Rajneesh movement and more, exploring the ways in which Asians have transformed the cultures of the Americas as much as their communities have been transformed by their new homelands.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nEligible for ASIA, PEAC\nFall 2021.

Her works consistently engaged the role memory, place, and community play in our lived experience.

In a moment when discussions about how-and sometimes, whether-we value Black bodies are happening all around us, this course offers us an opportunity to use the reading of Morrison\u2019s novels as a catalyst for new ways to think not only about how we can occupy place, but happily cohabit with our neighbors whether they look like us, share our point of origin, or reflect our values.

Indeed, it is safe to say that her work transcended what many readers ascertain as \u201cblack writing\u201d in the 21st Century. Her works consistently engaged the role memory, place, and community play in our lived experience. But how did Morrison understand her literary project in light of the fact that she eschewed the white gaze as a controlling motif in her fictions? In a moment when discussions about how-and sometimes, whether-we value Black bodies are happening all around us, this course offers us an opportunity to use the reading of Morrison\u2019s novels as a catalyst for new ways to think not only about how we can occupy place, but happily cohabit with our neighbors whether they look like us, share our point of origin, or reflect our values.

Scholars have long noted that the opposite is true-what we look like matters and greatly impacts our lives. Only coined in the 1980s, colorism, the preferential treatment of those with lighter skin and \u201cdesirable\u201d features, has plagued communities of color for centuries. In this course, we will trace the origins of colorism considering global contexts for communities of color in general, and the African diaspora in particular. We will use emerging theories of colorism to examine the role of racism, colonialism, media, and capitalism in engendering and maintaining colorist ideals in contemporary society. We will engage academic and \u2018non-academic\u2019 texts to expose the variations of systemic colorism on a global scale often impacted by other demographic markers including: gender, region, class, ethnicity, and culture.\nSocial sciences.\n1 credit.\nEligible for BLST, GLBL-paired\nFall 2021.

What is its relationship to our bodies? Is there a self? What is our relationship to the world?

We will also explore the ways in which a narrative advertises itself as a fiction, a piece of history, or a parable, and learn to recognize a narrative\u2019s rhetorical purpose and the more or less covert message it intends to convey.\nHumanities.\nWriting course.\n2 credits.\nCatalog chapter: Classics \nDepartment website: http://www.swarthmore.edu/classics"

One way to show these nice objects exist is to look at a random object, and show it has the nice property with nonzero probability. If this is true, there must be some object with this nice property. This is the Probabilistic Method in a nutshell. It has become an essential tool for understanding structure of lots and lots of things in theoretical computer science and combinatorics, even in problems and applications which involve no randomness at all.\nThis class will start from the ground up, first introducing discrete probability theory, then covering the probabilistic method in detail: how it works, extensions, and most of all lots of applications.

In doing so, we explore the theory behind the statistical techniques economists lean on, but also focus on practical applications and examples using real data. In the course, students will also gain experience in the use of Stata, the primary statistical package used by economists. The aim of the course is therefore not only to inform students about the theory behind the techniques used by economists to explore data, but also to empower students with the skills needed to analyze data on their own. \nPrerequisite: ECON 001 and ECON 031 or STAT 021\nSocial sciences.\n1 credit.\nFall 2021.

It will explore continuing debates over the appropriateness of education as a humanitarian intervention and examine what types of educational interventions are prioritized by humanitarian agencies, as well as the goals that those interventions are trying to achieve. For example, what is the relationship between education and conflict and how do education in emergencies providers intervene to alter that relationship? Students will have the opportunity to study specific examples of education in emergencies programming in countries such as Afghanistan, Colombia, Nepal, Sierra Leone, and Syria, and to hear from guest speakers working in the field of education in emergencies.

Indeed, it is safe to say that her work transcended what many readers ascertain as \u201cblack writing\u201d in the 21st Century. Her works consistently engaged the role memory, place, and community play in our lived experience. But how did Morrison understand her literary project in light of the fact that she eschewed the white gaze as a controlling motif in her fictions? In a moment when discussions about how-and sometimes, whether-we value Black bodies are happening all around us, this course offers us an opportunity to use the reading of Morrison\u2019s novels as a catalyst for new ways to think not only about how we can occupy place, but happily cohabit with our neighbors whether they look like us, share our point of origin, or reflect our values. In the process, we will endeavor to become a learning community in which critical thinking, analysis, dialogue, and debate are central to developing inclusive methods of inquiry.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nEligible for BLST\nFall 2023.

With contemporary environmental crises as its backdrop, this course examines some classic and contemporary anthropological approaches to the environment, exploring the value of anthropological theory, methods, and approaches in the humanistic study of the environment. In this sense, the course will expose students to diverse ways for thinking about the environment in its many dimensions and critical perspectives on contemporary environmental issues. We will review various theoretical approaches and their implications for our understanding of human relations to the environment, and explore how anthropologists and those they study are engaging with contemporary environmental issues including biodiversity conservation, deforestation, community-based natural resource management, ecotourism, and climate change.\nSocial sciences.\n1 credit.\nEligible for ENVS\nCatalog chapter: Environmental Studies \nDepartment website: https://www.swarthmore.edu/environmental-studies"

      "description": "Much of the history of colonization, and white supremacist racism has manifested an American landscape where geographic location is often the premier determinant of the material status of ones life. Namely, the life expectancy of Swarthmore Borough residents is over 12 years the life expectancy of Chester, PA residents\u2013 two spaces separated by a mere 3 miles. This course recognizes this life expectancy to be one particular measure of how space defines one\u2019s proximity, accessibility, experience, and legitimacy to the resources they need to thrive. In recognizing this difference and the injustices it perpetuates, it becomes our onus and accountability, as privileged Swarthmore students, to leverage our capacities to move our resources, money, and power to help augment ongoing initiatives and to learn from the ways that Chester residents are shaping the kind of reality they wish to see. . The course will originate from a macro-level consideration of the history of space and its intersections with politics, to provide a crucial understanding of the underlying themes of the built environment. Secondarily, the reading of how these theories penetrate the citizen, the self, and the consciousness will offer an important transition to confronting and examining how these theories manifest in issues at the regional, local, interpersonal, and individual levels. Case studies of Tri-State Area (New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) will allow the course to activate themselves alongside the stakeholders within these phenomena, namely Black, and Indigenous community members engaging in organized resistance. Ultimately, the course will center with a focus on Swarthmore and Chester, and course students will become designers, artists, scholars, activists, and more, to leverage their course experience to contribute their collaborative visions for a more spatially just Swarthmore-Chester continuum. Student work will understand, process, synthesize,  and contribute a direct impact, as all student work will be rooted in meeting the demonstrated needs of Chester Residents for Quality Living (CRCQL), Campus Coalition Concerning Chester (C-4),  and other community based groups. As this course is led by students in the Project Pericles, C-4 Chester Road Collaborative, course students will be active members, and expected to direct their individual creative and academic growth in a shared community of students and residents.\n \n1 credit.\nEligible for ESCH\nSpring 2022.

There has been a resurgence of interest in views like process philosophy-a view that suggests that unless we take interconnected becoming into account we cannot explain the novelty of life; panpsychism-a view that suggests that consciousness may be a fundamental component of the universe rather than an emergent effect of brains; biosemiotics-a view that suggests that even at the level of cells and unicellular organisms life operates through meaning-making rather than merely as mechanisms; and \u201cnew\u201d materialism-a view that suggests that even matter instead of being viewed as inert could be conceived as having a kind of agency of its own. These views, among others, in updated forms that take up again questions silenced at earlier points in time in new contexts-along with cross-cultural views that have never succumbed to the Western binaries of nature/culture, human/animal, and self/other-in light of the radical challenges facing us, are rich resources for rethinking our relationship to nature in ways that could foster the kind of shifts in self-understanding and investment in our relations to others and our surroundings that we need to survive.\nPrerequisite: First- and second-year students must complete one introductory level PHIL course before enrolling in this course.\nHumanities\n1 credit.\nEligible for ENVS.\nSpring 2022.

      "description": "(Cross-listed as ENVS 048)\nThe question of how we conceive of nature and our relationship to it is one that has become increasingly pressing as we deal with environmental issues that are rapidly reaching a critical point. There has been a resurgence of interest in views like process philosophy-a view that suggests that unless we take interconnected becoming into account we cannot explain the novelty of life; panpsychism-a view that suggests that consciousness may be a fundamental component of the universe rather than an emergent effect of brains; biosemiotics-a view that suggests that even at the level of cells and unicellular organisms life operates through meaning-making rather than merely as mechanisms; and \u201cnew\u201d materialism-a view that suggests that even matter instead of being viewed as inert could be conceived as having a kind of agency of its own. These views, among others, in updated forms that take up again questions silenced at earlier points in time in new contexts-along with cross-cultural views that have never succumbed to the Western binaries of nature/culture, human/animal, and self/other-in light of the radical challenges facing us, are rich resources for rethinking our relationship to nature in ways that could foster the kind of shifts in self-understanding and investment in our relations to others and our surroundings that we need to survive.\nPrerequisite: First- and second-year students must complete one introductory level PHIL course before enrolling in this course.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nSpring 2022.

Because that\u2019s what black people are, myths.

Students will explore ways in which the field of disability studies both draws from, as well as informs and expands, the fields of gender and sexuality studies and queer studies. The theoretical framework of the course focuses on the mechanisms that allow definitions, social constructions, and stigmas associated with disability to contribute to a larger system of power that oppresses individuals who fall short of the norm. We will orient ourselves by asking the following questions: How is disability socially constructed? How does disability intersect with other identities? How do various definitions of disability shape and affect advocacy agendas?  What are some institutional and social challenges faced by those with non-conforming bodies? Texts include disability studies theory, critical and theoretical essays, articles by disability rights scholars and activists, first-person accounts, films, art, and newspaper articles.\nNon-distribution.\n1 credit.\nEligible for GSST\nSpring 2023.

      "description": "Crosslisted GMST 056/LITR 056G\nThis Medical Humanities course invites students to pause and think about the contradiction inherent in human contact: on the one hand, we need it in order to flourish, while on the other hand, it poses potential risks.  Informed by a theoretical framework that draws on insights from fields such as Disability Studies, Cultural Studies, and Gender Studies, this course offers students the opportunity to analyze literature depicting both contagious outbreaks and life in isolation.  This literary examination will also allow students to explore the ethics of cure and human experimentation.\nAs part of a larger focus on the ways in which cultural representations of contagion are informed by cultural norms and how, in their turn, these representations have an impact on shaping and building cultural communities, students will be asked to consider the many connotations and valences of the term \u201ccontagion.\u201d  Most simply, the word \u201ccontagion\u201d denotes a risk of contamination, a potentially lethal danger to the exposed subject.  This course invites students to go beyond this literal interpretation of the word in order to contemplate the ways in which contagion challenges the notion of an isolated, self-contained self.  We will find that outbreak narratives enable us both to explore the intriguing possibility of a self with fluid boundaries that is constantly shaped by a community, and to cultivate empathy for other community members in the face of shared vulnerability.\nUsing literature in English translation to explore contemporary reactions to cholera, tuberculosis, HIV, as well as to vampires, we will consider how race, gender, class, and historical \u00e9poques shape illness stories.  Authors include Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, Elfriede Jelinek, Thomas Mann, Heinrich Heine, Fanny Lewald, Namwali Serpell, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Bertha von Suttner.\n1\nEligible for GLBL-Paired"

Informed by a theoretical framework that draws on insights from fields such as Disability Studies, Cultural Studies, and Gender Studies, this course offers students the opportunity to analyze German literature depicting contagious outbreaks, life in isolation, and explore the ethics of cure and human experimentation.\nAs part of a larger focus on the ways in which cultural representations of contagion are informed by cultural norms and how, in their turn, these representations have an impact on shaping and building cultural communities, students will be asked to consider the many connotations and valences of the term \u201ccontagion.\u201d  Most simply, the word \u201ccontagion\u201d denotes a risk of contamination, a potentially lethal danger to the exposed subject.  This course invites students to go beyond this literal interpretation of the word in order to contemplate the ways in which contagion challenges the notion of an isolated, self-contained self, to explore the intriguing possibility of a self with fluid boundaries that is constantly shaped by a community, and to cultivate empathy for other community members in the face of shared vulnerability.  Using German literature in English translation to explore literature on the plague, cholera, tuberculosis, HIV, as well on as vampires, we will consider how race, gender, class, and historical \u00e9poques shape illness stories.  In particular, we will look at the power dynamics that code contagions either as negative (where it refers, for instance, to a potentially deadly disease) or as positive (where it refers to contagious affects or an exchange of ideas).

Informed by a theoretical framework that draws on insights from fields such as Disability Studies, Cultural Studies, and Gender Studies, this course offers students the opportunity to analyze German literature depicting contagious outbreaks, life in isolation, and explore the ethics of cure and human experimentation.\nAs part of a larger focus on the ways in which cultural representations of contagion are informed by cultural norms and how, in their turn, these representations have an impact on shaping and building cultural communities, students will be asked to consider the many connotations and valences of the term \u201ccontagion.\u201d  Most simply, the word \u201ccontagion\u201d denotes a risk of contamination, a potentially lethal danger to the exposed subject.  This course invites students to go beyond this literal interpretation of the word in order to contemplate the ways in which contagion challenges the notion of an isolated, self-contained self, to explore the intriguing possibility of a self with fluid boundaries that is constantly shaped by a community, and to cultivate empathy for other community members in the face of shared vulnerability.  Using German literature in English translation to explore literature on the plague, cholera, tuberculosis, HIV, as well on as vampires, we will consider how race, gender, class, and historical \u00e9poques shape illness stories.  In particular, we will look at the power dynamics that code contagions either as negative (where it refers, for instance, to a potentially deadly disease) or as positive (where it refers to contagious affects or an exchange of ideas).  Authors include Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, Elfreide Jelinek, Thomas Mann, J. W.

This course will introduce students to these debates as they took shape in the American continent since 1960. With an emphasis on forms of art practice that outspokenly seek to provoke positive social change, this class provides a parallel narrative of contemporary art, in which art exits the museum space to ingrain itself in broader social processes.\nDuring the semester students will learn about different theories of socially engaged art articulated by artists and art historians alike. We will consider art as activism in the Civil Rights era, forms of artistic resistance to Latin American military dictatorships, second wave feminist art, contemporary community-based art, and forms of engaged art practice concerned with planet-wide environmental crisis. We will debate the tactics and ideals guiding these practices, and we will evaluate the potential risks that come with relying on art for social transformation.

Over 600 art fairs and biennial exhibitions structure a network where artworks, art professionals, and ideas circulate periodically, informing a community autonomous -yet connected to- local art scenes. In these last three decades, avant-garde art as practiced in Europe and the United States has expanded to acquire planetary visibility. Simultaneously, traditions of art making from other regions of the world have been welcomed -albeit in altered fashion-, into the central stages of the artworld. As historians, artists, and critics: How do we make sense of this shift? More importantly: How do we fit in this picture?\n  In this seminar, students will learn about the institutional, epistemic, and sociopolitical processes involved in the formation of \u2018global contemporary art\u2019 as a new art historical category. We will study the role that exhibitions, academia, and the art market play in the setting of artistic trends, while we analyze how these influences materialize in the practice of artists around the globe. During the semester students will engage with primary sources such as artworks and artists writings, and secondary sources from the art industry and academia alike. At the end of this course, students will be ready to describe the political, economic, and cultural processes active in the globalization of the art industry since 1990, and reflect on the consequences of this process in academic, practiced, and curatorial approaches to contemporary art.\nPrerequisite: Two courses in art history or permission of instructor.\nHumanities.\nWriting.\n2 credits.\nEligible for GLBL - Core\nSpring 2024.

Given the minor role to which it is relegated in the world and in Asia, how does the history of Southeast Asia get narrated in its literature-in particular, in literature written in or translated into English, the postwar lingua franca? This course charts modern Southeast Asian history through literature from or about its different periods-from the colonial era to the world between the wars to independence to the contemporary time. In the process, we will examine the literary strategies invented and adopted by locals to tell their (version of) history as well as the language of transmission-a language that, as it becomes more and more universal, might efface the very thing for which we are looking.

Informed by a theoretical framework that draws on insights from fields such as Disability Studies, Cultural Studies, and Gender Studies, this course offers students the opportunity to analyze German literature depicting contagious outbreaks, life in isolation, and explore the ethics of cure and human experimentation.\nAs part of a larger focus on the ways in which cultural representations of contagion are informed by cultural norms and how, in their turn, these representations have an impact on shaping and building cultural communities, students will be asked to consider the many connotations and valences of the term \u201ccontagion.\u201d  Most simply, the word \u201ccontagion\u201d denotes a risk of contamination, a potentially lethal danger to the exposed subject.  This course invites students to go beyond this literal interpretation of the word in order to contemplate the ways in which contagion challenges the notion of an isolated, self-contained self, to explore the intriguing possibility of a self with fluid boundaries that is constantly shaped by a community, and to cultivate empathy for other community members in the face of shared vulnerability.  Using German literature in English translation to explore literature on the plague, cholera, tuberculosis, HIV, as well on as vampires, we will consider how race, gender, class, and historical \u00e9poques shape illness stories.  In particular, we will look at the power dynamics that code contagions either as negative (where it refers, for instance, to a potentially deadly disease) or as positive (where it refers to contagious affects or an exchange of ideas).  Authors include Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, Elfreide Jelinek, Thomas Mann, J. W.

The growing ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity generated by international migratory flows has spawned fierce debates over national identity, social cohesion, and political stability. In order to make sense of these debates, we will analyze different regimes of immigrant integration, incorporation, and assimilation and evaluate the meaning of citizenship, social membership, and belonging.

Our personal biographies are linked to increasingly dense networks of global interrelations, as the integration of societies, economies, and cultures fundamentally transforms human life. The concept of globalization is contested, meaning that there are different and competing understandings of what the term means and how to assess the process. Regardless of how we conceive globalization, the concept occupies an increasingly prominent place in the social sciences and humanities and for a very good reason: it is impossible to understand the world in the early 21st century without understanding globalization and its consequences. The objective of this course is to explore what has come to be known as globalization studies, and in particular, to survey the distinct themes sub-areas that make up the sociology of globalization.

The emphasis is on the aspects of live performance that complete and complement the work of playwrights, with particular attention to performers, director/choreographers, designers, composers, etc.  Rather than pre-scripted drama and commodified models of theatrical production, we emphasize movement-based, ensemble-generated, non-verbal/non-discursive, interdisciplinary, political and ritual dimensions of performance.  The class includes units on performance traditions and genres beyond Europe, North America, and the anglophone world.  Assigned readings will emphasize the practice-based writings by or about theater artists such as Bharata Muni, Zeami, Stanislavsky, Artaud, Brecht, Mei Lan Fang, Lecoq, Grotowski,Schechner, Chaikin, Mnouchkine, Wilson, and Castellucci, along with selected theoretical and critical texts by nonpractitioners.  Each week will include a video lab of relevant performances (and field trips to live performances when possible).  Assigned writing will consist of a series of short analytical seminar papers and two major research papers, at least one of which will be devoted to research on performance beyond the Euro-American/anglophone cultural context.  The course will be taught remotely, and each week will consist of a required non-synchronous weekly video screening, a non-synchronous recorded lecture by the professor, and a 75-minute seminar discussion centered around student papers.

      "description": "\u201cBiopower\u201d and \u201cnecropolitics\u201d - two of the major buzz-words of our time - are often used interchangeably even though Achille Mbembe, who coined the term \u201cnecropolitics\u201d (the politics of death) in a seminal article from 2003, was critiquing the idea of \u201cbiopower\u201d (the politics of life) as it had been developed for decades in the work of Michel Foucault. This course locates these two concepts in the work of these two scholars. We will study the periods they reference - from the Jamestown Massacre in 1622 to the \u201cWar on Terror\u201d in the early 2000s - and look as well at the work they have inspired. In the first two weeks of the class, we will use these concepts and historical readings to create an alternative timeline of imperial history. The final projects will explore how this alternate timeline can help us write better, deeper, and more convincing histories of the present.\nPrerequisite: A history, HU, political science, sociology, or anthropology course at Swarthmore or permission of the instructor.\nSocial Sciences.\n1 credit.\nEligible for GLBL-Core\nCatalog chapter: History \nDepartment website: https://www.swarthmore.edu/history"

To that end, we will be taking a historical and cross-cultural view of scientific forms of thought in order to examine the multiple, complex relationships that obtain between individual human agents and their social milieus in the processes of creating and advancing scientific theories of the universe.  How, for example, do we take the measure of what we don\u2019t know?  How do we ascribe differential values to scientific questions and solutions?  In other words, what makes one question more important than another?  What makes a scientific theory \u201celegant\u201d or \u201cbeautiful,\u201d and why do (Western) scientists place epistemological value on such aesthetic considerations?

The starting point of the course is Machiavelli\u2019s novel \u201cscience\u201d of statecraft, which identified the state as the focal point of political activity, and announced that a good politician must be prepared to act immorally, or even love his city more than his soul. In other words, we begin with the thought of politics as a distinct sphere of activity, centered around the state, and separable from other spheres such as morality and religion. The problem of the modern state and the relationship of the political to other domains of life will guide our exploration of the fundamental concepts and debates of modern political thought. Other themes we will discuss include secularism and toleration, absolutist and popular sovereignty, constitutionalism and individual rights, theories of war and colonialism, and the relationship between social and political forms of domination. Authors include Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant, Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, Mary Wollstonecraft, Karl Marx, Max Weber and W.E.B.

Students will learn about patterns of regular and irregular migration, including economic and undocumented migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. We will also interrogate the efficacy of border walls and other strategies of containment and control. In the second part of the course we consider how migration transforms both sending and receiving countries and evaluate how countries accommodate (or fail to accommodate) newcomers to their territories. The growing ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity generated by international migratory flows has spawned fierce debates over national identity, social cohesion, and political stability. In order to make sense of these debates, we will analyze different regimes of immigrant integration, incorporation, and assimilation and evaluate the meaning of citizenship, social membership, and belonging. Classroom meetings will be supplemented with outside lectures and field trips in Philadelphia to observe immigration hearings and to meet with NGOs and community organizations working on issues surrounding migrant rights and refugee re-settlement.

This class offers an introduction to the politics of identity.

From Donald Trump\u2019s Muslim Ban to feminist critiques of the Islamic headscarf, politicians and pundits across the political spectrum have questioned Islam\u2019s compatibility with Western values and ways of life.

Over the course of the semester, we will read works by prominent theorists such as Wendy Brown, Frantz Fanon, Lila Abu-Lughod, Mahmood Mamdani, Edward Said, and Gayatri Spivak, and discuss how Islam figures into public conversations about anti-Semitism, citizenship and democracy, gender and sexuality, multiculturalism, national identity, secularism, tolerance, and political violence.

Religious communities have often employed secrecy as a strategy for the maintenance of group solidarity and religious identity when faced with allegations of heresy. Secrecy functions not only as a means to subvert and undermine the marginalization of religious minorities but as a powerful tool for the creation of more egalitarian possibilities through preservation of privileged knowledge and the presence of internally shared though externally undisclosed social and religious connections. What kinds of religious secrets are meant to be safeguarded? What set of behaviors and strategies are required to keep these \u201csecrets\u201d or sustain adopted personas? Is religious secrecy merely a tactic for ensuring survival in the context of social marginalization and political persecution? What is the relationship between secrecy and suspicion?

In fact, the mobilization of anti-corruption discourse in the region has become an undeniable force capable of toppling governments, sending corporate executives to prison, and bringing masses to the streets demanding change. What is the relation between today\u2019s \u201cwars\u201d against corruption and ongoing transformations of political and economic power in Latin America & the Caribbean? How has anti-corruption discourse reshaped imaginaries of political transformation and emancipatory politics in the region? Rather than assuming a singular definition of corruption, this course explores it as a powerful concept that is not simply or neutrally defined by law or morality - one with a complex history linked to colonialism and imperialism, as well as to changing ideas of democracy and justice. Through our readings and discussions, we will develop critical and analytical tools to interrogate the long-standing stereotype of Latin America as inherently \u201ccorrupt\u201d and how this stereotype is mobilized in the present. We will advance this critical work through exploring concrete cases that show the significance of anti-corruption politics as a tool for accountability and change.\nSocial sciences.\n1 credit.\nEligible for LALS, ESCH, GLBL-core\nSpring 2022.

We will consider art as activism in the Civil Rights era, forms of artistic resistance to Latin American military dictatorships, second wave feminist art, contemporary community-based art, and forms of engaged art practice concerned with planet-wide environmental crisis. We will debate the tactics and ideals guiding these practices, and we will evaluate the potential risks that come with relying on art for social transformation.

Of particular interest are the failures of the peacebuilding process, the current gang violence in the region, and the widespread political corruption supported by an economic system that has made of everyday life an exercise in survival.\nWe will pay special attention to U.S. intervention in Central America, particularly the consequences of its involvement in the military dictatorships and armed conflicts in the region. We\u2019ll focus on issues of social trauma and social disaffection, of historical memory and the genocide of the Mayas, of political resistance and the struggle for social justice, and of the limits of postwar reconstruction and reconciliation in the era of neoliberalism.

Their 90-minute reggae music concert featured a sonic-rhythmic-choreographic kaleidoscope looping the audience through 400 years of Rastafari mythic history and prophetic visions: although Africans were taken captive to Babylon (the American wilderness of racial capitalism), Jah Rasatafi had prepared a homeland in Ethiopia for the return of all Jah people, if only they chant down Babylon\u2019s destruction by preaching one love, good vibrations, and unity in I-and-I.\n\nThis class holds reggae music as a preeminent liturgical corpus of the Rastafari tradition, and investigates the Rasta worldview as performed by Bob Marley & the Wailers during their legendary Amandla set.

In this course, we will explore and discuss the work of established and emergent Latinx writers and artists that engage in practices of artivism trying to expose, better understand and fight the many forms of injustice and oppression faced by Latinx communities while promoting practices of radical democracy. Artivists such as Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Guillermo G\u00f3mez Pe\u00f1a, Tania Bruguera, Favianna Rodriguez, Daniel Alarc\u00f3n, among others, use their art not only to raise awareness about social injustices and oppression; their works function also as springboards for community building, solidarity, and political action that can have lasting impacts. The work of many artivists will also open the door to discuss how non-traditional forms of literary and artistic expression such as street art, spoken word, performance art, and artistic pedagogical projects are powerful forms of political intervention and citizenship participation. Furthermore, we will discuss issues such as the relevance of art in the contemporary world, the reception and distribution of politically engaged art, the ethics of artivism, and the importance of pedagogical practices based on a radical democracy model.\nThis course is taught in English. \nPrerequisite: No pre-requisites required.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nEligible for LALS\nFall 2023.

Works covered will include testimonies, memoirs, fictional literature and popular culture, bringing together authors such as Balzac, Zola, Camus, Sartre, Duras, and Tardi.

      "description": "The French novel witnessed a series of formal innovations throughout the nineteenth century that went hand in hand with developments in the fields of psychology and psychiatry. In the first half of the century, novelists like Stendhal and Honor\u00e9 de Balzac revolutionized the novel in ways that allowed for new levels of psychological depth, placing an emphasis on inner monologues, the sometimes-conflicting impulses motivating their characters, and detailed observations of the minutiae of everyday behavior. Building off these aesthetic innovations, novelists of the second half of the century pushed these psychological studies still further, turning directly to (and sometimes against) the work of psychiatrists, neurologists, and criminologists for inspiration-explicit and implicit references to the theories of Charcot, Lombroso, and Krafft-Ebing abound in the pages of the Realist, Naturalist, and Decadent authors constituting the corpus of this class. The following course will explore the dialogue that takes place between literature and psychology throughout the nineteenth century, tracking the novel\u2019s shift from broad depictions of madness to more nuanced psychiatric diagnoses and even sympathetic depictions of various psychological states that speak to contemporary discussions around neurodiversity. Authors include: Chateaubriand, Stendhal, Balzac, Flaubert, Zola, Maupassant, Baudelaire, Rachilde (in addition to excerpts from primary sources of nineteenth-century psychology). \nTaught in French.\nPrerequisite: Fr 15 or with instructor permission.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nSpring 2023.

Informed by a theoretical framework that draws on insights from fields such as Disability Studies, Cultural Studies, and Gender Studies, this course offers students the opportunity to analyze German literature depicting contagious outbreaks, life in isolation, and explore the ethics of cure and human experimentation.\nAs part of a larger focus on the ways in which cultural representations of contagion are informed by cultural norms and how, in their turn, these representations have an impact on shaping and building cultural communities, students will be asked to consider the many connotations and valences of the term \u201ccontagion.\u201d  Most simply, the word \u201ccontagion\u201d denotes a risk of contamination, a potentially lethal danger to the exposed subject.  This course invites students to go beyond this literal interpretation of the word in order to contemplate the ways in which contagion challenges the notion of an isolated, self-contained self, to explore the intriguing possibility of a self with fluid boundaries that is constantly shaped by a community, and to cultivate empathy for other community members in the face of shared vulnerability.  Using German literature in English translation to explore literature on the plague, cholera, tuberculosis, HIV, as well on as vampires, we will consider how race, gender, class, and historical \u00e9poques shape illness stories.  In particular, we will look at the power dynamics that code contagions either as negative (where it refers, for instance, to a potentially deadly disease) or as positive (where it refers to contagious affects or an exchange of ideas).

      "description": "This honors seminar examines the broad array of designed and built works, makers, sites, and texts that constitute modern architecture and urbanism. Students will interpret the many facets of modernism through key historical readings-both primary and secondary, canonical and revisionist; analysis of examples; and consideration of their makers, both well-known and less so. A guiding assumption is that modernism was never only one thing and had different-even sometimes opposite-intentions, manifestations, and consequences in different contexts. Yet we will follow one persistent question as a link across the semester: how did modern architects and urbanists seek to create a better world? The motivations behind and answers to this defining question of modernism were never consistent across our period of study. While centering designed objects, then, we will interrogate how people have experienced modernism differently, depending on their identities, subject positions, geographic locations, and social roles. \nPrerequisite: Two courses in art history or permission of instructor.\nHumanities.\n2 credits.\nSpring 2022.

Students will learn about patterns of regular and irregular migration, including economic and undocumented migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. We will also interrogate the efficacy of border walls and other strategies of containment and control. In the second part of the course we consider how migration transforms both sending and receiving countries and evaluate how countries accommodate (or fail to accommodate) newcomers to their territories. The growing ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity generated by international migratory flows has spawned fierce debates over national identity, social cohesion, and political stability. In order to make sense of these debates, we will analyze different regimes of immigrant integration, incorporation, and assimilation and evaluate the meaning of citizenship, social membership, and belonging. Classroom meetings will be supplemented with outside lectures and field trips in Philadelphia to observe immigration hearings and to meet with NGOs and community organizations working on issues surrounding migrant rights and refugee re-settlement.

As a region that is popularly perceived as an arena for intractable ethnic and religious conflict, authoritarian political regimes, and social and economic underdevelopment, the Middle East has long been a critical site in global affairs. Recent events such as the toppling of long-standing governments in places like Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya during the so-called \u201cArab Spring,\u201d the electoral successes of Islamist political parties in countries with a history of secular rule such as Turkey, and the repercussions of the on-going civil war in Syria, including the displacement of millions of persons, renewed bids for Kurdish autonomy, and the rise of ISIS have raised new and pressing questions about the future of the region. This course aims to help students contextualize and better understand the current political climate by tracing the roots of these conflicts to the longer history of state and nation formation in the Middle East. Throughout the semester students will learn about political, economic, social, and cultural developments within a number of countries in the Middle East and North Africa.

Over the course of the semester, we will read works by prominent theorists such as Wendy Brown, Frantz Fanon, Lila Abu-Lughod, Mahmood Mamdani, Edward Said, and Gayatri Spivak, and discuss how Islam figures into public conversations about anti-Semitism, citizenship and democracy, gender and sexuality, multiculturalism, national identity, secularism, tolerance, and political violence. Through our readings and discussions, students will learn about the diversity of lived experiences of Muslims in Western societies and explore the connections between race, religion, and the afterlives of empire.     \nComparative\nSocial Sciences.\n1 credit.\nEligible for GLBL-Core, GMST, ISLM, INTP, GSST\nSpring 2023.

Informed by a theoretical framework that draws on insights from fields such as Disability Studies, Cultural Studies, and Gender Studies, this course offers students the opportunity to analyze German literature depicting contagious outbreaks, life in isolation, and explore the ethics of cure and human experimentation.\nAs part of a larger focus on the ways in which cultural representations of contagion are informed by cultural norms and how, in their turn, these representations have an impact on shaping and building cultural communities, students will be asked to consider the many connotations and valences of the term \u201ccontagion.\u201d  Most simply, the word \u201ccontagion\u201d denotes a risk of contamination, a potentially lethal danger to the exposed subject.  This course invites students to go beyond this literal interpretation of the word in order to contemplate the ways in which contagion challenges the notion of an isolated, self-contained self, to explore the intriguing possibility of a self with fluid boundaries that is constantly shaped by a community, and to cultivate empathy for other community members in the face of shared vulnerability.  Using German literature in English translation to explore literature on the plague, cholera, tuberculosis, HIV, as well on as vampires, we will consider how race, gender, class, and historical \u00e9poques shape illness stories.

Finally, we will analyze how visual adaptations-whether cinematic adaptations of graphic novels or graphic adaptations of movies and novels-reshape their original sources and adapt them to a new purpose.\nTaught in English. 0.5 credit attachment for students reading in French.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nEligible for FREN\nCatalog chapter: Modern Languages and Literatures: Literatures in Translation \nDepartment website: http://www.swarthmore.edu/modern-languages-literatures"

In opposition to the Enlightenment idea of the rational man is the irrational animal, a binary that materialist thinkers like La Mettrie and Condillac are quick to blur; in opposition to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (the crowning civil rights document from the French Revolution) is Olympe de Gouges\u2019 Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen, a text that criticizes eighteenth-century gender inequalities; in opposition to the Enlightenment\u2019s enormous blind spots surrounding race is Claire de Duras\u2019 Ourika, a novel that decries the pervasive racism of the eighteenth century. Throughout the semester, we will study the novels, essays, and dialogues that shape the major ideas of the Enlightenment (and the revolutionary modes of thinking that accompany it), while also studying that which lies in the shadow of the Enlightenment.

How have its familiar stock characters, plotlines, settings, and recognizable styles adapted? What accounts for its ability to speak to audiences across different cultural backgrounds while emanating from and representing cultural, national, and regional specificities (Scandinavian crime, American film noir)?

As storytelling device, as historical document, as expression of imagination, as artistic object, there is no form more capable of capturing our interest and provoking the senses. Therefore, some of the main objectives in this course will be:\nTo understand the nature and process of film production\nTo learn how to \u201cread\u201d and analyze film\nTo explore the major aesthetic trends in the history of cinema and familiarize ourselves with the main theoretical and critical approaches to film theory.\nThe films and readings assigned for each class meeting are selected because of their relevance to the theories for the week (often this relevance will be implicit rather than explicit) - for instance: The Photographic Image and Sound, The Cinematic Narrator, Reality and Film, The Film Spectator, Film Genre, etc. The goal of the course is not to focus on any single theory or group of theories, but rather to review a large selection of theories, and allow the students to practice applying these theories to film, so that by the end of the course each student will have the critical tools to provide an informed verbal and written film analysis, and be able to discuss how various aesthetic and ideological approaches to filmmaking influence cinema practice over time.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nSpring 2023.

To answer this question, this course surveys literature from the last days of the Russian Empire, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, and the turbulent present of the Post-Soviet World.\n\nTogether, we will consider how literary authors grapple with catastrophic upheaval, from the rapid construction of industrial socialism, to Stalin\u2019s purges, World War II, the Gulag labor camps, and the Russian war on Ukraine in 2014 and the present. We will encounter fantastic, tragic, and absurd tales from a wild century: a battle of values in the early USSR between a rebel and a sausage maker; the joys and tribulations of post-revolutionary sexual liberation; a surreal night of drunkenness on the Moscow Metro; a lifetime in Soviet Central Asia recounted as astronauts make contact with a utopian society in a distant galaxy.\n\nAll are welcome.

The course will explore the shifts in sexuality and gender constructions from national to transnational symbols through the songs and dances (item numbers) in Bollywood cinema and its most visible media platform, T.V Reality Shows.  We will explore this through viewing and analyzing select screen performances in three parts: First, we will examine the place of the erotic in reconstructing gender and sexuality from past notions of romantic love (associated with ghazal songs or classical and folk dances) to desires for commodity. Second, we will explore the aesthetic shifts from the traditional song and dance repertoire to trendy MTV-inspired moves. We will examine how transnational images of commodity production intersect with sexuality, desire, spirituality, and modernity in these screen dances.  This course will explore the song and dance sequences through video-viewing and studio work (with a Bollywood choreographer) as well as reading a few key texts.

Though usually modest in size, songs have exerted a powerful influence on, and been an indispensable reflection of, our collective emotional and actual lives. How songs come into being is somewhat ethereal, and only recently have educators and practitioners begun to treat songwriting as a scholarly discipline. This course frames the art and act of songwriting in historical context, offering a combination of background information and hands-on practice.\nThe class has two main components. First, through survey and analysis, we will examine the wide literature of songs throughout history: its traditions, its mechanisms, and its connections to human society and culture. Next, students will create their own songs, applying the principles and techniques learned through study of the repertoire. We will examine the process of songwriting, from inception through execution to completion, by closely observing and keeping journals of our own work, and by welcoming guest artists to the class to discuss their songwriting processes and experiences. Topics to be discussed include melody, rhythm, style, instrumentation, song forms, singing,\ndancing, and rhyming, among many others. All genres are welcome, and both traditional and non-traditional approaches are encouraged. A basic knowledge of music and some musical skill, vocal or instrumental, are highly recommended.\nHU\n1\nSpring 2022. Church."

      "description": "A focused survey of 20th-century music centering on the great renewal of musical expression, increasingly diverging from the Austro-German classic-Romantic tradition, found in the works of these three very individual French and Russian composers, as well as the resonance of their music in the work of their contemporaries and successors, including Ravel, Dukas, Prokofiev, Boulez, and others. The course begins by tracing the origins of this \u201calternative\u201d conception of what music can do, and how it can work, well back into the 19th century, especially in the music of Liszt and the Russian \u201cMighty Handful\u201d, then considers its continuing and seminal contribution to musical modernism throughout the 20th century. Prof. Levinson is a former student and assistant to Olivier Messiaen.\nSome of the principal works to be studied are Debussy\u2019s Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun,  La Mer, the opera Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, and songs and piano works;  Stravinsky\u2019s ballets  Petrushka, The Rite of Spring, and others, Symphony of Psalms, Symphony in Three Movements,  and the late serial works of the 1960s; Messiaen\u2019s Quartet for the End of Time, Turangal\u00eela Symphony, Oiseaux exotiques, The Transfiguration,  the opera Saint Francis of Assissi, and songs, piano and organ works.\nPrerequisite: MUSI 011 or permission of the instructor.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nCatalog chapter: Music and Dance: Music \nDepartment website: http://www.swarthmore.edu/music"

How does the nature of the crisis (political, economic, social, and environmental) impact communities differently? How are grassroots actors, civil society institutions, states, and international organizations responding to these challenges in their nation-states and across borders? What transnational networks of solidarity have linked the Middle East to other regions across the globe? For instance, this course will examine the consequences of environmental degradation and escalating food prices on conflict and instability across the region. We will trace the origins of autocratic regimes in the Middle East and social movements calling for rights and reforms on one hand and the rise of fundamentalism and terrorism (i.e. Al-Qaeda and ISIS). Furthermore, the course will explore crises such as contemporary Syria, and how local and international interventions aimed at reversing the marginalization of-and threats against-minority populations (ethnic, religious, gender, sexuality, ability) have come to constitute a realm of crisis management. By understanding crises through the theoretical prism of human security frameworks, we will ascertain the prospects for democratization, development, pluralism, and peace in the region.\nSocial sciences.\n1 credit.\nEligible for ISLM, PEAC, ESCH\nCatalog chapter: Peace and Conflict Studies \nDepartment website: http://www.swarthmore.edu/peace-conflict-studies"

We examine both the prevalence of coercive and non-peaceful means of conducting conflict as well as the development of nonviolent alternatives, locally and globally, through institutions and at the grassroots. The latter include nonviolent collective action, mediation, peacekeeping, and conflict transformation work. Several theoretical and philosophical lenses will be used to explore cultural and psychological dispositions, conflict in human relations, and conceptualizations of peace.

Already, climate change has been identified by the U.S. military as a threat to national security, offering a new rationale for expanding the military industrial complex. Demands on scarce resources generate and exacerbate regional conflicts and drive mass movements of refugees. Behind these dramatic manifestations of climate stress lie extensive corporate and national interests and hegemonic silences that emerging conflicts often reveal. Conflict also brings new opportunities for peacebuilding, cooperation, and conflict resolution. Climate crises have renewed and expanded local and global movements for environmental justice and protection, many of which have historical connections with the peace movement.

Anchored in two wars-World War II, from which the US emerged as a world power, and the Vietnam War, the first televised war and America\u2019s \u201cunwinnable war\u201d-this course focuses on Asian/American entanglement and the worlds to which it gives rise. There are multiple Japans that emerged in World War II: the empire that might have conquered the US, as imagined in the alternate history of The Man in the High Castle; the lost land of origin that has brought trauma on its \u201cheirs,\u201d the Japanese interned by the US; the Japan experienced by comfort women in Asia. Similarly, the story of the Vietnam War has been told almost exclusively from an American viewpoint. Yet The Sympathizer promises to tell another story: not only of the US in Vietnam as seen by the Vietnamese but of the Vietnamese in America, indeed of two Vietnams. What might we learn from alternate (hi)stories about the political functions and ontological power of narrative? Texts may include The Man in the High Castle, No-No Boy, Comfort Woman, The World at War, Cold War, Apocalypse Now, Vietnam War protest poetry, The Sympathizer, Night Sky with Exit Wounds, We Should Never Meet, Forgetting Vietnam, Maya Lin, and the Vietnamese Oral History Project, along with theoretical texts on war and reality.

But if human rights operate within the framework of the nation-state, the problems of the contemporary moment do not.  How, then, do we begin to imagine the rights-bearing human in an age of mass migrations, privatized militaries, global flows of capital, climate crises, and the world wide web?  The first section of this class will be devoted to studying the ways human rights advocacy and practice has traditionally depended upon narrative structures (testimony, witnessing, reportage) and the sympathetic imagination in order to raise awareness of atrocity.  The second half of the class will explore how such attempts to narrate the human face new obstacles in the twenty-first century.  Course readings will include a wide array of narrative forms, from novels, memoirs, photography and film to ad campaigns, NGO reports, and Freedom Information Act requests. Primary texts will be supplemented by secondary readings (Jacques Derrida, Hannah Arendt, Giorgio Agamben, Joseph Slaughter, Deborati Sanyal, and Eyal Wiezman) and by research labs that will introduce students to local and regional human rights work.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nEligible for PEAC, ESCH\nFall 2023.

Already, climate change has been identified by the U.S. military as a threat to national security, offering a new rationale for expanding the military industrial complex. Demands on scarce resources generate and exacerbate regional conflicts and drive mass movements of refugees. Behind these dramatic manifestations of climate stress lie extensive corporate and national interests and hegemonic silences that emerging conflicts often reveal. Conflict also brings new opportunities for peacebuilding, cooperation, and conflict resolution. Climate crises have renewed and expanded local and global movements for environmental justice and protection, many of which have historical connections with the peace movement. In support of the college\u2019s carbon charge initiative, we will dedicate part of the course to understanding what constitutes the social cost of carbon and how it is represented in carbon pricing, particularly with respect to increasing frequencies of armed conflict and extension of the military industrial complex.\nSocial Science.\n1 credit.\nEligible for ENVS, ESCH, PEAC\nFall 2021.

      "description": "Home to many of the world\u2019s oldest civilizations and major religions, the Middle East remains a region of remarkable cultural diversity. From the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1922 to the Arab Spring and the current refugee crisis, this vast territory has experienced extraordinary political and social change over the past nearly one hundred years.  While often riven by conflict, the Middle East is also a site of ever-renewing intellectual, artistic, and political movements. The musical soundtrack to this constellation of dynamic forces is rich and complex, animated by shifting social environments and ongoing intercultural encounters.  Arabs, Turks, Persians, Jews, Kurds, Greeks, Berbers, Armenians, Assyrians, and many other ethno-linguistic and religious identities all claim unique forms of musical expression, mirroring in many cases their environments-rural, urban, desert, coastal, seafaring, nomadic, antiquated, hypermodern, pious, and defiantly secular. In this course we will examine nearly a century of music making in the Middle East focusing on Turkey, Iran, and the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa. Readings, audio examples, films, and in-class music making will address the ways that music of the Middle East intersects with religious practices, nationalism, gender, sexuality, language, ethnicity, migration, and protest movements. Through an exploration of elite, popular, folk, and sacred music among others, we will attempt to make sense of the rich and varied soundscapes of the modern Middle East.\n1 credit.\nEligible for PEAC\nCatalog chapter: Music and Dance: Music "

The growing ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity generated by international migratory flows has spawned fierce debates over national identity, social cohesion, and political stability. In order to make sense of these debates, we will analyze different regimes of immigrant integration, incorporation, and assimilation and evaluate the meaning of citizenship, social membership, and belonging.

In addition to reading literary works by some of the main authors in the region-such as Horacio Castellanos Moya, Rodrigo Rey Rosa, and Claudia Hern\u00e1ndez-we will analyze scholarly debates surrounding Central American literature, as well as watch films and performances that probe into the issues of ethics, historical truth, social justice, reconciliation, and the human predicament in a postwar society.\nHumanities.\n2 credits.\nEligible for LALS, PEAC, GLBL-Paired, CPLT\nSpring 2022.

In this course we will take a chronological look at the distinct world-views of philosophers like Plato, Descartes, and Nietzsche, and then look at the perspectives of some contemporary theorists, in order to ask ourselves questions about when and how we know something to be true, what it is that we desire and why, and how revealing the assumptions we take for granted might affect our perceptions of both.\nHumanities.\nWriting course.\n1 credit.\nCatalog chapter: Philosophy \nDepartment website: http://www.swarthmore.edu/philosophy"

Some of the sub-questions we will address are as follows: What are the sources of knowledge? What do we have reason to doubt? How do we acquire knowledge from what other people tell us? How, if at all, should we adjust previously-held beliefs upon learning that others disagree with us?\nStudents will be encouraged to think creatively about their own answers to the central questions in the theory of knowledge, while appreciating the influential answers coming from a diversity of voices and perspectives in the history of philosophy.\nPrerequisite: First- and second-year students must complete one introductory level PHIL course, before enrolling in this course.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nFall 2021.

The starting point of the course is Machiavelli\u2019s novel \u201cscience\u201d of statecraft, which identified the state as the focal point of political activity, and announced that a good politician must be prepared to act immorally, or even love his city more than his soul. In other words, we begin with the thought of politics as a distinct sphere of activity, centered around the state, and separable from other spheres such as morality and religion. The problem of the modern state and the relationship of the political to other domains of life will guide our exploration of the fundamental concepts and debates of modern political thought. Other themes we will discuss include secularism and toleration, absolutist and popular sovereignty, constitutionalism and individual rights, theories of war and colonialism, and the relationship between social and political forms of domination. Authors include Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant, Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, Mary Wollstonecraft, Karl Marx, Max Weber and W.E.B.

Using U.S. political history as a vessel to understand contemporary political inequality, we will trace legacies of ascriptive hierarchy, slavery, xenophobia, racism, Jim Crow, indentured servitude, neglect, segregation, malapportionment, and restricted franchise to gain insights into why this nation remains highly unequal in politics. These historical legacies are further compounded by contemporary problems, such as gerrymandering, voter ID laws, politician-led pressures to decrease political participation, bureaucratic capture by special interests, disparities between public opinion and policy outcomes, elections predicated on money, and representation that varies in quality based on group status and geographic location. By understanding the incentives and interests of political actors in power, we will better understand why institutions and laws reconstruct U.S. politics, oscillating between greater equality and continued inequality. In this course, we will use political science, sociology, history, economics, law, and philosophy texts to better understand the incidence of political inequality, how it violates core precepts of democracy, and the ramifications of an inequitable political system. We will also scrutinize how socioeconomic factors influence political power, how political institutions mediate power, and how politics feeds back to reify or alter socioeconomic dynamics. Special attention is devoted to understanding political inequality in relation to race, ethnicity, migration, class, gender, political parties, interest groups, social movements, and geography.\nSocial Sciences.\n1 credit.\nSpring 2022.

      "description": "Even though the executive branch is relegated to the loosely defined second article of the U.S. Constitution, presidential power has greatly expanded over time, in the process reshaping American politics to revolve around presidential initiative. In the contemporary era, coequal branches of the government defer to the president, while voters look to the president to solve a snowballing set of public problems. However, the rise in executive power has not satisfied expectations, leading to the confounding dual problem of presidents purportedly having too much power in some domains, while still struggling to adequately fix society\u2019s most pressing problems. This course examines how and why presidential power has grown throughout American history, with special attention to the following questions: To what extent is a presidency-centered system both a consequence of and incompatible with a separated powers system? What is the relationship between changes in the sources of presidential authority and the exercise of power in the executive branch? Are there any limits to presidential power, and if so, what are they? Normatively, should the president have less or more power? Finally, is successful mastery of the presidency our best hope for functional governance, or is the modern presidency a problem in and of itself? To answer these questions, we will focus on the historical development of the executive branch, spotlighting the important contributions-and idiosyncrasies-of all 46 U.S. presidents.\nSocial Sciences.\n1 credit.\nCatalog chapter: Political Science\nDepartment website: http://www.swarthmore.edu/political-science"

In the second part of the course we consider how migration transforms both sending and receiving countries and evaluate how countries accommodate (or fail to accommodate) newcomers to their territories. The growing ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity generated by international migratory flows has spawned fierce debates over national identity, social cohesion, and political stability. In order to make sense of these debates, we will analyze different regimes of immigrant integration, incorporation, and assimilation and evaluate the meaning of citizenship, social membership, and belonging.

We will focus on the judicial politics surrounding the Civil Rights movement, environmentalist movements, feminist movements, and LGBTQ movements.  We will also focus on the judicial politics of economic regulation, immigration, national security, and elections/campaign finance.

And yet, there are over 93 thousand governmental entities with jurisdiction over 330 million Americans.

This enormous scale of government not only belies the myth of a libertine America, but it suggests Americans actually cannot get enough government. What gives? To understand this conundrum-and more broadly the contours of American politics-one must understand the role of public policy. How are policies made? What are the effects of policy? What factors contribute to policy success or failure? How do policy design and issues with implementation contribute to public sentiment? We often think about the need for new policies to solve our problems, but give less attention to the role existing policies continue to play in our lives. In the course, we will analyze public policy through a political science lens, utilizing the concepts of path dependency, layering, drift, conversion, policy feedback, and unforeseen externalities to better understand the American policyscape.

How do civil wars end and what can local, regional and international actors do to facilitate their termination? To explore these and other questions, students will be introduced to key concepts, theories and a variety of research approaches, including qualitative, quantitative, and interpretive methods as well as micro- and macro-level analysis. Contemporary and historical cases we will examine include: Syria, South Sudan, Nigeria, Rwanda and Yugoslavia.\nPolitical sciences.\n1 credit.\nEligible for GLBL- core; GSST, PEAC\nSpring 2022.

We first investigate the growth of the US surveillance state in the second half of the 20th century and the role of surveillance and repression in several authoritarian regimes in Latin America during that time period.  We then consider how technological changes have amplified the capacity of states to surveil citizens in the 21st century and the struggles of different societies across the Americas to place appropriate limits on such activity, examining topics like mass communications collection, the spread of commercial spyware, the exportation of surveillance technologies to Latin American countries by both the US and China, and the role of big tech companies whose business models has been termed \u201csurveillance capitalism.\u201d\nComparative\nSocial Science.\n1 credit.\nEligible for LALS, PEAC\nSpring 2023.

The notion of \u201cpossession\u201d contains a double meaning, referring in one register to phenomena of trance, ecstasy, and other embodied engagements with Spirit(s), historically identified by religious studies scholars as hallmarks of African Diasporic ritual traditions. In yet another register, the notion of \u201cpossession\u201d chains Black religion to the history of the Transatlantic Slave Trade and its logic of racial capital that sold Black bodies as commodities to be possessed by a master. By way of ethnographic field reports, videos, films, and readings in critical race theory, kinesthetics, and phenomenology, students will untangle these tropes of Black spirit and possession to discover what their alternative, Africanist perspectives might teach us about the nature of Being, consciousness, materiality, and how to live well in ancestral community.\nHumanities.\n2 credits.\nEligible for BLST, LALS\nSpring 2022.

Anthropologists study various societies to understand how meaning is constituted and circulated, how daily practices are structured by social norms and power systems, and how people resist, subvert, and transform inequalities and common modes of identification. Drawing on deep engagement with specific groups, communities, and processes, anthropology offers unique insights into pressing questions of our time, such as the effects of the global circulation of capital and people and how social structures, cultural-political ideologies, and everyday life interact. Topics to be covered include ritual and religion, kinship and family, gift and exchange, citizenship and nationalism, gender and sexuality, medicine and healing, media and circulation, and food and consumption.

But how do anthropologists practice their craft? What exactly do they do \u201cout there\u201d in the field and what is unique about their modes of studying human experience?

The first half investigates how citizenship intersects with forms of difference such as race, class, gender, sexuality, and ability. Ethnographic examples include debates about the legal recognition of gay marriage, spatial struggles over the right to the city, and disability activism and the biopolitics of citizenship. The second half examines how new forms of mobility of people, ideas, and capital challenge the nation-state as the site of political membership. What is the state\u2019s responsibility towards its \u201cothers\u201d: from transnational entrepreneurs to illegal migrant workers, and from political refugees to the detainees at Guantanamo Bay?\nSocial sciences.\n1 credit.\nEligible for ESCH\nSpring 2022.

The human experience of sickness entails a complex interplay between biological, socio-economic and cultural factors. This course offers an introduction to medical anthropology, and draws upon social, cultural, biological, and linguistic anthropology to better understand those factors which influence health and well being (broadly defined), the experience and distribution of illness, the prevention and treatment of sickness, healing processes, the social relations of therapy management, and the cultural importance and use of pluralistic medical systems. Topics covered include how beliefs about health, disease and the body are constructed and transmitted, how healers are chosen and trained, social disparities in health and illness, and the importance of narrative and performance in the effectiveness of healing practices. Finally, we will consider the ways in which medical anthropology can shed light upon important contemporary medical and social concerns.\nSocial sciences.\n1 credit.\nEligible for ESCH, GLBL - Core\nFall 2021.

Is law really the opposite of violence when the state relies on \u201clegal violence\u201d to enforce its own laws? Our exploration of the thorny question of \u201clegal violence\u201d is situated within a particular trajectory of social, political, and anthropological thought, perhaps best articulated in Walter Benjamin\u2019s 1921 essay, \u201cCritique of Violence,\u201d a cryptic yet influential text in which the German thinker formulated the idea that violence is constitutive rather than antithetical to law. Our goal is to take a closer look at the ways in which law is entwined with violence and explore how, although formulated one hundred years ago, Benjamin\u2019s argument remains critical for contemporary debates about police violence as well as critiques of liberal democracy and capitalism. In this seminar, students can expect to engage closely with works in anthropology, philosophy, political theory, and legal studies alongside art and film exploring the relation between law and violence as well as recent writing in different genres by feminist, queer, and thinkers of color who further expand and challenge how we think and act in relation to the law and its violence.

Economic, social, environmental and political events around the world have put global racial hierarchy in stark relief. In the United States, the Coronavirus pandemic is revealing and exacerbating existing racial inequalities. The continued state sponsored killing of Black people has sparked the latest iterations of the Black Liberation Movement within and across multiple boundaries. In this interdisciplinary course, we will investigate and uncover the seeds of these movements in previous eras, the conditions of white supremacy that continue to call forth resistance, and the manifestations of that constant resistance globally, nationally, and local to our city of Philadelphia. In partnership with the Pulitzer Center, students will work with preeminent journalists, local organizers and community members to create a podcast that will serve as a digital archive to tell multifaceted stories of Black Liberation 2020.    \nSocial sciences.\n1 credit.\nEligible for BLST, GLBL-core\nCatalog chapter: Sociology and Anthropology \nDepartment website: https://www.swarthmore.edu/sociology-anthropology"

Images of migrants making their way to the nearest border, families being separated through deportation and children being detained in cages fill our screens. But, do we understand what causes people to migrate in the first place? To understand this, we need to analyze the root causes of transnational migration as well as the politics involved in it. This will require engagement with issues of power, the legal system and the production of migrant illegality, race, the nation-state, etc. Rather than only a survey of theories related to the topic, this class is designed to provide you with a holistic approach to the study of migration from a critical sociological perspective.\nSocial sciences.\n1 credit.\nEligible for ESCH, LALS, GLBL-core\nFall 2021.

      "description": "(Cross-listed as LITR 062S and LALS 062)\n(Art)ivism, or the practice of social and political activism through art and artistic devices, has been fundamental for the development and strengthening of Latinx communities in the US since the beginning of the Chicano movement until today when Latinx writers and artists are actively involved in politically contentious issues such as racial discrimination, gender equality, immigration rights, environmental justice, among others. In this course, we will explore and discuss the work of established and emergent Latinx writers and artists that engage in practices of artivism trying to expose, better understand and fight the many forms of injustice and oppression faced by Latinx communities while promoting practices of radical democracy. Artivists such as Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Guillermo G\u00f3mez Pe\u00f1a, Tania Bruguera, Favianna Rodriguez, Daniel Alarc\u00f3n, among others, use their art not only to raise awareness about social injustices and oppression; their works function also as springboards for community building, solidarity, and political action that can have lasting impacts. The work of many artivists will also open the door to discuss how non-traditional forms of literary and artistic expression such as street art, spoken word, performance art, and artistic pedagogical projects are powerful forms of political intervention and citizenship participation. Furthermore, we will discuss issues such as the relevance of art in the contemporary world, the reception and distribution of politically engaged art, the ethics of artivism, and the importance of pedagogical practices based on a radical democracy model.\nThis course is taught in English. \nPrerequisite: No pre-requisites required.\nHumanities.\n1 credit.\nEligible for LALS\nFall 2023.

However, this universalistic reading ignores the ties that unite him to Argentine and Latin American cultural traditions.

The class is strongly recommended to all acting students and may be taken without prerequisite. \n0.5 credit.\nSpring 2023.

      "name": "Performance Theory and Practice",
      "description": "This seminar-format course provides a global road map to written and embodied theories and practices of live performance: cross-culturally, cross-historically, and across genres.  The emphasis is on the aspects of live performance that complete and complement the work of playwrights, with particular attention to performers, director/choreographers, designers, composers, etc.  Rather than pre-scripted drama and commodified models of theatrical production, we emphasize movement-based, ensemble-generated, non-verbal/non-discursive, interdisciplinary, political and ritual dimensions of performance.  The class includes units on performance traditions and genres beyond Europe, North America, and the anglophone world.  Assigned readings will emphasize the practice-based writings by or about theater artists such as Bharata Muni, Zeami, Stanislavsky, Artaud, Brecht, Mei Lan Fang, Lecoq, Grotowski,Schechner, Chaikin, Mnouchkine, Wilson, and Castellucci, along with selected theoretical and critical texts by nonpractitioners.  Each week will include a video lab of relevant performances (and field trips to live performances when possible).  Assigned writing will consist of a series of short analytical seminar papers and two major research papers, at least one of which will be devoted to research on performance beyond the Euro-American/anglophone cultural context.  The course will be taught remotely, and each week will consist of a required non-synchronous weekly video screening, a non-synchronous recorded lecture by the professor, and a 75-minute seminar discussion centered around student papers.  The course will end with final critical research paper on a topic of the student\u2019s choice (no final exam).  \nRecommended in sophomore or junior year.\nFulfills a general requirement for all theater majors and minors.\nPrerequisite: THEA 001 or consent of instructor.\nHumanities.\nWriting course.\n1 credit.\nEligible for GLBL-Core\nFall 2021.

Institutional dramaturgy: script evaluation, season planning, mission statements, grant proposals, marketing and audience outreach.

It\u2019s hard to continuously and repeatedly summon the strength and the will to practice optimism. How do we, as artists, as activists, as humans living on this planet, find ways to imagine a future where things work out? Where suffering and disaster aren\u2019t the inevitable end-state?\n\nThis course explores how we build emotional, collective resilience in the face of the many crises of our time. Working through the lens of climate crisis, students will engage with: 1) the work of local activists (e.g. The Sunrise Movement, PhillyThrive, the Earth Quaker Action Team), 2) the writings of facilitators/authors working on collective action and building a sustainable future (e.g. Joanna Macy, Adrienne Maree Brown, Robin Wall Kimmerer), and 3) the tools of theater (e.g. vulnerability, creativity, embodiment) to explore: How do we process our intense, exhausted, or numbed feelings? What do we mean by collective power, and how will we fuel movements for the future together? How do we begin to dream of our future with practicality, hope, and even joy?\n\nNo prior experience in activism or theater required.\nCross-listed with ENVS 054\n   \n1 credit.\nFall 2022.
